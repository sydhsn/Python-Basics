# Python Basics

Welcome to the **Python Basics** repository! This project contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed for beginners who are looking to learn Python programming from the ground up. The repository offers easy-to-follow, step-by-step tutorials covering the core concepts of Python.

Whether you're a student, a professional looking to learn a new language, or someone interested in enhancing your Python skills, this repository provides the foundational knowledge needed to get started with Python programming.

### Why Learn Python?

Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and powerful libraries. Whether you are interested in data science, web development, automation, or artificial intelligence, Python is an excellent choice.

### What Will You Learn?

This repository covers the following fundamental Python concepts:

- **Literals in Python**: Understand how to use different types of literals such as integers, floats, strings, and more.
- **Operators in Python**: Learn about arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators to perform calculations and logic operations.
- **Type Conversion**: Learn how to convert data types in Python and work with type casting.
- **Python Data Types**: Explore Python’s built-in data types like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Taking User Input**: Learn how to interact with users by taking input via the console.
- **Print Function**: Master the `print()` function and understand how to display output in Python.
